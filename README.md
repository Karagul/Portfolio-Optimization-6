# Modern Portfolio Theory

--- 

This repository contains an implementation of the Mean-Variance Mdoel, that I imeplemented for a senior mathematics capstone course (MATH441 - Mathematical Modelling and discrete optimization problems) at the University of British Columbia. In this project I compared the performance of the Mean-Variance Model to the more robust Mean-Absolute-Deviation Model.

This implementation contains the option of allowing for short sales (negative weifhts) and to restrict individual weights.

I have since implemented a better version in Julia found here:
