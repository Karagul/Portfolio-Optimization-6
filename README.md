# Modern Portfolio Theory

--- 

This repository started off as a project I worked on for the course MATH441 (Mathematical Modelling and discrete optimization problems) at the University of British Columbia. In the project I compared the performance of the classic Mean-Variance Model to the more robust Mean-Absolute-Deviation Model.

Over the course of this summer (2018) I added some new features to the model, some that I was
able to find online (the maximum sharp-ratio portfolio) and some that I tediously had to figure out myself (allowing for short-positions, individual weight restrictions for assets and target return specification). I use this repository for exploration and testing of methods.
