# Markowitz (Mean-Variance) Model

--- 

This is a project I worked on for the course MATH441 (Mathematical Modelling and discrete optimization problems) at the University of British Columbia. I used a similar but simpler model for the capstone course. Over the course of the summer I added some new features to the model, some that I was
able to find online (the maximum sharp-ratio portfolio) and some that I tediously had to figure out myself (allowing for short-positions and individual weight restrictions for assets).
